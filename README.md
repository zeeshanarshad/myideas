# My Ideas
Quickly write down your idea without wasting too much time with any complicated software or mobile app, and access it within your browser without internet.

# The Benefits

- Get rid of your new idea quickly before it overlaps your mind to DISTRACT you from your current FOCUSED work
- Keep track of all your new and instant ideas on a single web page
- Quickly add, edit or remove the idea anytime as you wish
- Work on any idea whenever you want when you are DONE with your current project/task/goal

The purpose is pretty simple, keep things simple, stupid and clean. 

Feel free to improve the app but just keep as simple as it can be, we don't need much complication in today's messy world.
